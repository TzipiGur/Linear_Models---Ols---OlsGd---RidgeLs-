# Linear_Models-Ols-OlsGd-RidgeLs

A peek to a linear models which gives a basic idea of Ols (Ordinary Least Square), OlsGd(Ols using gradient descent) and RidgeLs(Ridge Linear Regression (add penalty))

Each of the models is defined by a Class that contain initialization of Hyper-parameters and required methods like: fit, predict etc.

For OlsGd there is a stage of normalization.

For RidgeLs there is a stage of penalty (Lambda).

The code contains notes.
